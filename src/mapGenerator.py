'''
For each cell in the queue, it loops over the 4 cardinal directions and does the following:

Determine the neighbour cell by adding +10/-10/+1/-1 to the currency cell.
If the neighbour cell is already occupied, give up
If the neighbour cell itself has more than one filled neighbour, give up.
If we already have enough rooms, give up
Random 50% chance, give up
Otherwise, mark the neighbour cell as having a room in it, and add it to the queue.
