Description:
Dungeon Diver is a short questing game, where the player must explore various rooms and gear up to defeat a boss in order to win. Players have the freedom to explore rooms however they like and each time they play the game, their experience will be different because the dungeon map is different for every play through. Since this is the case, Dungeon Diver provides a variety of playthrough scenarios for players.
